<!-- Definition:
Event delegation is a technique where instead of attaching event listeners to multiple child elements, you attach a single event listener to a common parent element. The event bubbles up from the target to the parent, and the parent handles it.

ðŸ§  Why It's Useful:
Improves performance (fewer event listeners).

Useful when child elements are dynamically added.

Keeps code cleaner and easier to manage.

ðŸ§ª Example:
js
Copy
Edit
document.getElementById('list').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
  if (e.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    console.log('List item clicked:', e.target.textContent);
  }
});
ðŸŸ¢ Here, instead of attaching a click listener to every <li>, we attach one to the parent <ul> (with ID list), and use e.target to check which child was clicked.
